      <h3>Hi everyone, this is Baicha (Pornnatcha)</h3>
      <p>
        - I am undergraduate student in Data Science. I love to analyze data and numbers, 
          the most fun part is where I notice patterns and insight (is it the same for you all? XD) <br>
        - My university journey start 2 years earlier than my peers, I which this early start reflect my proactive
          approach to learn and my commitment to achieve ambitious goals. 
        - I started journey at James Cook Univeristy Singapore by being awarded a Merit Scholarship. I am also
          Peer Tutor for IT student in Data Mining.
      </p>
